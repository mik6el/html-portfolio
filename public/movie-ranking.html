<h1>The Best Movies/Shows According To Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies/shows of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
    <p>This movie is one of my favorites because of the main character and how the love interest is a polar opposite creating a funny dynamic as first. Which builds up and allows the movie to mature and grow into a frantic race of undoing past mistakes and reconciling with relationship mishaps.</p>
<h3>Steins;gate</h3>
    <p>I think that the plot and again similar to the movie above the the protagonist is just really relatable and interesting to see how he deals with saving the entirety of the whole world from collapsing to the feet of evil while saving his friends and love interest.</p>
<h3>Cars</h3>
    <p>Cinematic Masterpiece.</p>
